# openHAB_Proj
This repository is the Python environment for my final year project of an Electrical and Electronic bachelors degree at the Technological University of Dublin. The project looked at creating a soft real time control loop which minimised electrical disturbances on the Irish Grid System through the use of smart metering and smart plugs.
