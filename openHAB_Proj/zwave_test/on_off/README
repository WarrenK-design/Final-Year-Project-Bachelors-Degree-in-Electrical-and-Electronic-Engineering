The purpose of this directory is to test the reponse time of openhab 
The tests will send an on/off command to the switches configured in openhab
There are rules in the openhab file on_off.rules that are trigged by a change in switch states
These rules call the script timestamp.py and pass it the output csv file to write a timestamp and value to 
These output csv files are in the results/ directory  

	four_devices.py 	- Turns all devices on and then off in a for loop
	on_off_by_group 	- This script turns all 4 plugs on and off by group
	on_off_by_group_delay   - This script turns all 4 plugs on and off by group but there is a delay every loop

The resulst of each of the tests are generated to the results/ directory and have been moved manually after the tests
